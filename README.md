# DSCV

## Overview

*Warning: it's work in progress*

This is a GUI program using Nana library. It launches an executable file to multiple processes connecting their text streams, using Boost.Process.
This project aims to avoid repetitive copy, paste & re-opening when making a code for online judge.

I'm sorry that it's WIP. Soon there will be added licenses from libraries.

Written in C++14 with MSVC 2015 Community Update 3.

* [Nana C++ Library](http://nanapro.org/en-us/) 1.5.5
